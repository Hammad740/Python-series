In Python, an object is a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on the data. Everything in Python is an object, including integers, strings, lists, functions, and even classes themselves. Objects are instances of classes, which are like blueprints for creating objects. 

Each object has:

1. **Identity**: This is a unique identifier for the object. It's guaranteed to be unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. You can get an object's identity using the `id()` function.

2. **Type**: Every object has a type, which defines what kind of object it is and what operations it supports. You can check the type of an object using the `type()` function.

3. **Value**: This is the data that the object holds. For mutable objects like lists and dictionaries, the value can change. For immutable objects like integers and strings, the value cannot change after creation.

For example, consider a simple integer object:

```python
x = 5
```

Here, `5` is an object of type `int`, and `x` is a reference to this object. You can inspect its identity, type, and value like this:

```python
print(id(x))   # Identity
print(type(x)) # Type
print(x)       # Value
```

Output:
```
140725243605680
<class 'int'>
5
```

Understanding objects and their properties is fundamental to Python programming, especially when working with concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP) and memory management.
