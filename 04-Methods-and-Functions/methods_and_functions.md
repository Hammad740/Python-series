In Python, both methods and functions are blocks of reusable code that perform specific tasks. However, there are subtle differences between them.

**Functions:**

1. **Definition**: Functions in Python are blocks of code that carry out a specific task when called. They are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parameters (if any), and a colon. The body of the function is indented below the definition.
2. **Scope**: Functions are standalone blocks of code that can be defined at the module level or within other functions. They can be called from anywhere within the same module or from other modules if they are imported.

3. **Parameters**: Functions can accept input parameters, which are variables passed to the function when it is called. These parameters are defined within the parentheses in the function definition.

4. **Return Value**: Functions can return a value using the `return` statement. The value returned by the function can be assigned to a variable or used in other parts of the code.

5. **Example**:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

**Methods:**

1. **Definition**: Methods are similar to functions but are associated with objects. They are functions that belong to a class and are accessed via instances or the class itself.

2. **Scope**: Methods are defined within classes and are accessible through instances of that class or the class itself. They operate on the data contained within the instance (or class) they belong to.

3. **Parameters**: Similar to functions, methods can also accept parameters. The first parameter of a method is always a reference to the instance itself, conventionally named `self`.

4. **Return Value**: Methods can also return values using the `return` statement. They can manipulate the internal state of the instance and return results accordingly.

5. **Example**:

```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

calc = Calculator()
result = calc.add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

**Key Differences:**

1. **Scope**: Functions are standalone blocks of code, while methods are associated with objects and belong to classes.

2. **Access**: Functions are called by their name, while methods are called using dot notation on an object or class.

3. **First Parameter**: Methods have a special first parameter conventionally named `self`, which represents the instance calling the method.

4. **Usage**: Functions are used for general-purpose tasks, while methods are used to manipulate the data associated with objects.

In summary, functions are standalone blocks of code, while methods are functions associated with classes and are used to manipulate data within instances of those classes.

In Python, the terms "argument" and "parameter" are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings in the context of functions and methods.

**Parameter**:

- A parameter is a variable in a function or method definition. It is a placeholder for the actual value (argument) that will be passed to the function or method when it is called.
- Parameters are defined within the parentheses in the function or method definition.
- Parameters are used to specify the input that a function or method expects to receive.
- Parameters are essentially the variables that will be used within the function or method to perform operations or computations.

Example:

```python
def greet(name):  # Here, 'name' is a parameter
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("Alice")  # 'Alice' is an argument passed to the 'name' parameter
```

In this example, `name` is the parameter of the `greet()` function.

**Argument**:

- An argument is the actual value that is passed to a function or method when it is called.
- Arguments are the concrete values supplied to the parameters of a function or method during the function or method call.
- When a function or method is called, the arguments are provided within the parentheses, and they are matched with the parameters in the function or method definition based on their order or by keyword.

Example:

```python
def add(x, y):  # 'x' and 'y' are parameters
    return x + y

result = add(3, 5)  # 3 and 5 are arguments passed to the 'x' and 'y' parameters
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

In this example, `3` and `5` are the arguments passed to the `add()` function.

**Key Differences**:

- Parameters are defined in the function or method declaration, whereas arguments are the actual values passed to the function or method during the function or method call.
- Parameters are placeholders for arguments, while arguments are the actual data that is passed to the function or method for processing.
- The number of parameters in a function or method definition determines the number of arguments that need to be provided during the function or method call.
- Parameters determine the structure and behavior of the function or method, while arguments provide the data that the function or method operates on.
